## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
libraries
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```




1.1.1
There are 3 rules that make dataset tidy,each variable has their own columns,each observations has their own row, each value must have its own cell.
```{r}
View(billboard)

```
This data is tidy as it has one column for each variable (artist, track, data, and week),
It has one row for each obeservation and finally it has one cell for each observation. The missing values (na) are important as they tell us when a particular track was not on the top 100 billboard list

1.1.2 

```{r}
View(fish_encounters)
```

Again, this data is tidy. It has one column for each variable (fish, station, seen).  It also has one row observation and finally it has one cell for each measurement.

The data set has a missing set which is ovservations were the fish has not been observed.  As an example take fish 4865.  It has not been seen at Rstr.  Similarly fish 4864 has not been seen at Lisbon etc.

One way to remedy this might be to enter new rows for these "non" observations. This can be done rather cleverly as follows: 

```{r}
fish_encounters %>% pivot_wider(
  names_from = station, 
  values_from = seen,
  values_fill = 0
)
```



1.1.3
```{r}

View(us_rent_income)
```
In this table each observation has two rows (income, rent) and the margin of error.  It is therefore not tidy and this needs to be fixed

```{r}
us_rent_income %>%
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = variable, values_from = c(estimate,moe))
```
